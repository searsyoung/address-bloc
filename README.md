### Exercises

For the following situations, determine which search approach to use and why would you take that approach. Write your answers in the submission box below.

> Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name

A. Since the list is sorted, I'd use a binary search.

> Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend

A. Assuming the list isn't large, I'd use an iterative search. If it was large, then I'd consider sorting first and using something more performant like a binary search.

> Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.

A. Iterative search since the data set is small so performance would not be a concern.

> Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints

A. Since the dataset is small, doing an iterative search through each checkpoint for a match wouldn't be that much of a concern from a performance standpoint.
